# Back-end Developer Test

Be sure to read **all** of this document carefully,
and follow the guidelines within

## Can choose one of business context by level

## What We Care About

Use any libraries that you would normally use if this were a real 
production App.

**Please note**: we're interested in your 
- code (code-style and logic)
- the way you solve the problem
- how you organize commits, 

...not how well you can use a particular library or feature.

_We're interested in your method and how you approach the problem just 
as much as we're interested in the end result._

Here's what you should strive for:

- Good use of current Node.js & API design best practices. 
- Solid testing approach.
- Extensible code.

If you have not been specifically asked, you may pick either 
`Implementation Path: Docker Containers`

## Implementation Path: Docker Containers

### Basic Requirements

- Use Node.js `LTS` and any framework of your choice (Nest JS is preferred).
- Use any persistence store.
- Write concise and clear commit messages.
- Write clear **documentation** on how it has been designed and how to 
run the code.
- Use linting code

### Bonus
- Use event-driven architecture instead of RESTful
- Provide proper unit tests.
- Add a read only endpoint to fetch location information based off the user's 
address (use [NASA](https://api.nasa.gov/) or 
[Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/api-documentation/) APIs)
- Use Docker containers.
- Utilize Docker Compose.
- Providing an online demo is welcomed, but not required.

### Advanced Requirements

These may be used for further challenges. 
You can freely skip these if you are not asked to do them; 
feel free to try out if you feel up to it.

- Provide a complete user auth (authentication/authorization/etc) strategy, 
such as OAuth.
- Build a filter feature that can filter records with
some of the attributes.
- Can add C4 model architecture schemas

## Q&A

> Where should I send back the result when I'm done?

Fork this repo and send us a pull request when you think you are done. There is no deadline for this task unless otherwise noted to you directly.

> What if I have a question?

Create a new issue in this repo and we will respond and get back to you quickly.

## GOOD LUCK COMRADE!
